# Streaming Music Application

This is a software product developed using C#, allowing each user to easily play his/her favorite music. The product has numerous features, which are of a great advantage for each person who loves
listening to music trough a streaming platform. It offers creating playlists, publishing new songs, adding (distributing) songs to playlists and manage libaries. 

The product has been entirely developed using C# Object Oriented Code (OOP) trough the WPF framework in Visual Studio. The focus has been put more on functinality, refractored and clean code and performance, rather
than design (by now, changes will be applied in terms of eye-appealingness).
